The 'View' interface we were given requires a specific 'Model' as defined by their code.
Aside from that inconvenience, everything else about the interface is good.
The interface alows creating multiple views (createView(Model, int))
by simply passing in a 'Model' and a time to start the playback at.
At this point, 3 different views can be created.

A Gui view object requires a 'Model' to be passed in to be created.
However, a Midi view object can be created without a 'Model'.
The 'Model' can subsequently be added using createView(Model, int).
A Combo view takes a Gui and Midi view to be created, and the 'Model'
 to be viewed is subsequently assigned using the createView method,
 by calling createView on both view types.

The views are capable, and allow playing and pausing, as well as
handling mouse and keyboard input. Moving forwards and backwards
in the piece is abstracted within the interface. The code was
convenient to use and well documented, albeit dependent on the
specific Model implementation requiring us to remake our Model
into their Model to user their views.
